### Purpose
To build a database of the voting records of all congressmen on all bills and issues.

Motivated by the discovery that some representative hasn't voted in 6 months because she's in a dementia care facility.

### Outline
 The main index for the sessions is at [Congress' website](https://www.congress.gov/roll-call-votes).  The House urls are outdated and redirect to the House's main index page.  The Senate urls are solid and lead directly to the page of interest.

Information for the House can be found [here](https://clerk.house.gov/Votes).

Information for the Senate can be found [here](https://www.senate.gov/legislative/votes_new.htm).  It's clunky to navigate from here though as you have to choose a session from a dropdown.  The url from Congress' site leads directly to the page of interest.
